## Introduction

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) plays a crucial role in providing scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystem health, environmental changes, and the impacts of climate and land use. Their team of scientists continuously develops new methods and tools to deliver timely and relevant insights about the Earth's processes. However, the USGS currently faces a challenge in effectively visualizing the vast amount of earthquake data they collect from around the world each day. To address this, you have been tasked with creating a visualization tool that will help the USGS present their earthquake data more meaningfully. This tool aims to enhance public education and inform other government agencies, while also supporting the USGS's efforts to secure funding for addressing these critical planetary issues.
